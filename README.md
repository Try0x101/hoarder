[2025-07-01 16:00 UTC] REFACTORING_COMPLETED: Android app modularization from 3 large files to 10 specialized modules. UIHelper.kt split from 750 lines to 80 lines coordinator + 4 specialized managers (LayoutManager, StatusManager, DialogManager, LogViewer). DataUploader.kt split from 368 lines to 150 lines coordinator + NetworkUploader, BufferManager modules. DataCollector.kt split from 258 lines to 150 lines + NetworkDataCollector module. Each module operates independently with fail-safe isolation, preventing cascade failures.
[2025-07-01 15:45 UTC] ERROR_FIXED: Math.maxOf import resolution failure in DataCollector.kt. Caused by Kotlin version incompatibility with kotlin.math.maxOf function. Fixed by replacing maxOf() calls with Java Math.max() function calls maintaining identical functionality for location accuracy calculations.
[2025-07-01 15:30 UTC] OPTIMIZATION_IMPLEMENTED: PowerShell export script streamlined for token efficiency. Removed verbose environment details, Android SDK listings, build tool versions. Focused file selection on core project files (*.kt, essential *.xml, *.properties). Reduced file size limit from 500KB to 200KB. Direct targeting of source directories eliminates build artifacts capture.
[2025-07-01 14:15 UTC] EPOCH_OPTIMIZATION: Timestamp system changed from 1-month rolling to fixed epoch (June 30, 2025 00:00:00 UTC). BufferManager.saveToBuffer() modified to calculate secondsSinceFixedEpoch = now.epochSecond - fixedEpoch.epochSecond. Eliminates timestamp corruption from offline data spanning month boundaries. LogViewer.formatLogEntry() updated to handle both string/numeric ts values with epoch conversion: (tsLong + 1719705600) * 1000 for Date construction.
[2025-07-01 13:45 UTC] BSSID_OPTIMIZATION: WiFi MAC address format optimized from "50:ff:20:58:69:72" (17 chars) to "50ff20586972" (12 chars). NetworkDataCollector.collectWifiData() modified: wi.bssid.replace(":", "") removes colons. Saves 5 bytes per record (29% reduction). Server reconstruction requires inserting ":" every 2 characters. IEEE MAC address standard guarantees 12 hex character format consistency.
[2025-07-01 13:30 UTC] TYPE_SAFETY_IMPLEMENTATION: Complete JSON value conversion to strings for fail-safe parsing. DataCollector.convertToStringMap() converts all values: String->String, Number->toString(), else->toString(). DataUploader.convertToStringMap() handles null values as "null" string. Eliminates JSON type inconsistency errors from mixed integer/string data transmission.
[2025-07-01 13:00 UTC] UI_DESCRIPTION_UPDATE: Data description fields updated for new optimizations. Timestamp section changed from "3-month quarter" to "fixed epoch (June 30, 2025)". BSSID field description updated to "compact format without colons". Added deployment warning requiring server epoch coordination. Field reference updated with optimization details: string conversion, BSSID compact format, fixed epoch benefits.
[2025-07-01 12:30 UTC] ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS: Project structure optimization completed. Current stats: 15 Kotlin files (93.61 KB, 2,261 lines), 75 XML files (2.08 MB, 19,916 lines). UIHelper.kt identified as oversized (750 lines = 33% of Kotlin code). Total source code 2.17 MB (3.1% of 70.43 MB project). Build artifacts comprise 96.9% of project size. Modular refactoring targets maximum 150-200 lines per file for fail-safe operation.
